PLACEHOLDER FOR WINDOWS EXECUTABLE
====================================

This file is a placeholder for the Windows executable.

To create the actual Windows .exe file:

1. Follow the instructions in WINDOWS_BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md
2. Replace this file with the actual SIH_Disk_Wipeout.exe
3. The .exe file should be approximately 300-400MB in size

Current Status:
- Linux executable: ✅ Available (322MB)
- Windows executable: ⏳ Pending (requires Windows machine)

The Windows executable will be created when:
- Building on a Windows machine, OR
- Using Wine for cross-compilation, OR
- Using GitHub Actions for automated builds

Once created, users can simply double-click the .exe file to run
the SIH Disk Wipeout software without any installation required.
